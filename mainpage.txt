/** @mainpage Non HAL Library
  * 
  * This is the library for STM32 with functions absent in the HAL library. This library contains function that can be
  * useful for working with external periphery or for internal purposes. The functions in this library may be located 
  * elsewhere on the internet, but in this library they're in same place. I often use this functions and think it will come
  * in handy for other users HAL library and STM microcontrollers.
  *
  * You can find the source code of the library on [GitHub](https://github.com/darkyfoxy/Non_HAL_Lib) 
  *
  * @section What_the_library_contains What the library contains
  *
  * At this moment, the library contains follow main modules:
  *   + non_hal_conv.c - functions for converting numeric types to a character string and vice versa;
  *   + non_hal_kalmfilter.c - functions to filter data with the fast Kalman filter.
  *
  * @section How_to_use How to use
  *
  * If you are using the STM32f4xx family:
  *   + Make sure that you include the HAL library (use the CubeMX to do it). After that, you can just include the 
  *     **non_hal_lib.h** file in your main project file (e.g. main.c or main.h).
  * 
  * Otherwise:
  *   + In additional, you must rename the include in **non_hal_lib.h** (`#include "stm32f4xx_hal.h"`).
  *
  * @section Documentation Documentation
  *
  * The Doxyfile file is the project file for [**Doxygen**](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html). If you need the html 
  * documentation on this library you can generate it. You can use Doxywizard or use console command:
  * @code
  * doxygen ./Doxyfile
  * @endcode
  *
  * And the documentation will be generated in the ./doc directory.
  *
  * @section Issues Issues
  *
  * If the library doesn't work or if you know about potential errors (and mistakes, typos, ets.), please let me know 
  * (vlavit97@gmail.com or https://t.me/darkyfoxy).
  *
  * If you know how to improve performance or want to add new functions, I look forward to your pull requests.
